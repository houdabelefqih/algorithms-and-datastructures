TASK 1 : Compilation and execution instructions 
______________________________________

To compile the code (you must first of all enter the folder where the .c file is located):
gcc -o ss stable_selection_sort.c

To run with user input :
./ss

To run the code with data from a file (example numbers1.txt): 
./ss < numbers1.txt 

NOTE : the command to redirect inputs from a file works if the text file is in the same folder as the executable, if it is not, you must include the entire path of the file.
